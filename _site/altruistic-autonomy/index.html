    <p>Have you ever felt you are losing too much time in traffic? Have you
ever asked why all the cars on the roads can’t just all go with some
constant speed? Most drivers have had such thoughts. And if you live in
a large city, you may relate to this funny scene from “Office Space”:</p>

<figure align="figure">

<p>In this post, we will present a mathematical model of traffic congestion
and explain why it happens using this model. Afterwards, we will analyze
the effects of a recently emerging and popular technology, autonomous
cars, on traffic congestion. As we showed in our WAFR 2018 paper,
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11978">“Altruistic Autonomy: Beating Congestion on Shared Roads”</a>, autonomous
cars have the potential of significantly reducing traffic congestion!</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<h3 id="mathematical-model-of-traffic">Mathematical Model of Traffic</h3>

<p>Decades ago, researchers came up with a beautiful model of traffic, and
they called it <em>Fundamental Diagram of Traffic</em> (FDT). While it has
several similar forms, the <em>triangular model</em> is widely adopted since it
allows analytical investigation. The triangular model plots flow (the
number of cars per second going through a point on the road) versus
density (the number of cars per meter over some stretch of the road at
any given second):</p>

<figure class="figure"><div class="figure__main">
<p><a href="/blog/assets/img/posts/2018-11-26-altruistic-autonomy/image1.png"><img class="postimage_unpadded" src="/blog/assets/img/posts/2018-11-26-altruistic-autonomy/image1.png" /></a></p>
</div><figcaption class="figure__caption" style="padding-top:0;"><p>Fundamental Diagram of Traffic</p>
</figcaption></figure>

<p>Note the rising edge on the left (blue) and the falling edge on the
right (brown). The rising edge represents the state of <em>free-flow</em>,
where all cars can go with the maximum legally allowed speed. Imagine
there is only a single car on the highway -- it would just go with the
maximum speed. But, both traffic density and flow would be low, because
after all it is just one car!</p>

<p>If we add a second car, they will still go with the maximum speed. Both
density and flow will be doubled. However, we cannot just keep inserting
new cars and expect them to go with the maximum speed. There is a rule:
<strong>all drivers have to keep a distance of 2 seconds with the car in the
front</strong> (so that they can respond in time in case the car in front
unexpectedly brakes)<strong>.</strong> Hence, at some point while inserting cars to
the road, drivers will have to slow down or otherwise cars cannot fit to
road. This is where we transition from the rising edge of the triangle
to the falling edge, which represents the congested region. While the
car density keeps increasing, the flow will now decrease because all
cars are slowing down. This is shown by the second important plot of
model, that of latency (the time it takes to travel from one point to
another on the road) vs flow:</p>

<figure class="figure">
    <img align="middle" class="postimagesmaller" src="/blog/assets/img/posts/2018-11-26-altruistic-autonomy/traffic-model-2.png" />
</figure>

<p>In the free-flow regime, latency is constant, since all cars are going
with the maximum speed. However, as we increase density and move to the
<em>congested region</em>, it rapidly increases.</p>

<h3 id="routing-problem">Routing Problem</h3>

<p>In its simplest form, the routing problem asks the following question:
<em>How do we allocate a given traffic flow (into N parallel roads) such
that the total latency is minimized?</em></p>

<p>It may be confusing that we are given a traffic flow, not a traffic
density. Although this might sound unintuitive, it becomes more and more
sensible when you think about it: Would you enforce a constraint that
states “there will be 500 cars on this road”, or a constraint “there
will be 500 cars who want to go from point A to point B between 5pm and
6pm”? The latter one is more natural, and so used in the routing
problem. We also simplify the traffic network as N parallel roads, which
enables more mathematical analysis by ensuring we can use single
density, flow and latency values for one road without any partitioning.</p>

<h3 id="nash-equilibria">Nash Equilibria</h3>

<p>Now, we can state the main cause of traffic congestion (and perhaps many
other problems in the world): <strong>Humans are selfish.</strong> Imagine you live
in Los Angeles, and want to go from Beverly Hills to the Valley. The
shortest path you could take is Coldwater, which would normally take 25
minutes. The second best alternative is to take the highway 405, which
would take 30 minutes. But it is Friday afternoon, so both Coldwater and
405 are congested and will take, say, 32 minutes. The other best
alternative is to take Laurel, which is free of congestion. However,
that road is long and the maximum speed is low, so it would already take
35 minutes.</p>

<figure>
    <img class="postimage_50" src="/blog/assets/img/posts/2018-11-26-altruistic-autonomy/map.png" />
</figure>

<p>Then, you make your decision: You take Coldwater, because it is 3
minutes faster. But, you are not alone -- everybody does the same
thing. Now sit back and think for a while: When you decide taking
Coldwater, it was already congested. In other words, there were lots of
cars taking that road. After you and many others decide to take it
because it is 3 minutes faster for you, the road became even more
congested - and will now take 34 minutes. It is still better than
Laurel, isn’t it? If you (and others who made the same decision as you)
had taken Laurel, you would have lost a few minutes, but hundreds of
cars on Coldwater would have enjoyed a few minutes less travel time.
You, along with many others, basically caused social bad, for your own
good.</p>

<p>Well, we don’t blame you. This is Nash equilibrium (NE), where no car is
willing to change the road it took, and you did what you are expected to
do! As long as a road is faster than the others, people will choose to
take it. So what’s the problem? The problem is Nash equilibrium is not
unique and some of those equilibria can be really bad.</p>

<figure class="figure"><div class="figure__main">
<p><a href="/blog/assets/img/posts/2018-11-26-altruistic-autonomy/image6.png"><img class="postimage_unpadded" src="/blog/assets/img/posts/2018-11-26-altruistic-autonomy/image6.png" /></a></p>
</div><figcaption class="figure__caption" style="padding-top:0;"><p>Two different Nash equilibria as solutions to the same routing problem.</p>
</figcaption></figure>

<p>If you look at these two flow-latency plots (note that each plot has the
model of all three roads), you will see two different configurations.
The crosses represent the state of the road. Both configurations are a
Nash equilibrium, because all used roads have the same latency level,
i.e. no drivers would benefit from changing the road they are taking.
The surprising point is that they are both a solution to the
[same]{.underline} routing problem -- the total flow in both
configurations are exactly the same! However, in the second
configuration drivers experience a much higher latency. With more
complex and crowded networks, things can be <em>unboundedly</em> worse.</p>

<h2 id="best-nash-equilibrium">Best Nash Equilibrium</h2>

<p>Among the Nash equilibria, which one or ones are the best? And what’s
the criteria for being better than the others? You guessed it! The best
Nash equilibria (BNE) are the ones that minimize the latency experienced
by <em>all</em> drivers. So for example, in the previous figure, the first NE
is better than the second one. Could it be better? Yes! In fact, we
showed that in the BNE, one road has to be in free-flow<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, because
otherwise we could just decrease the latency to the next highest
free-flow latency road’s free-flow latency, and then easily adjust the
flow values to match with the demand.</p>

<figure class="figure"><div class="figure__main">
<p><a href="/blog/assets/img/posts/2018-11-26-altruistic-autonomy/image8.png"><img class="postimagesmaller" src="/blog/assets/img/posts/2018-11-26-altruistic-autonomy/image8.png" /></a></p>
</div><figcaption class="figure__caption" style="padding-top:0;"><p>Best Nash Equilibrium for the above routing problem. 405 is now in free-flow.</p>
</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>So, what’s special about autonomous cars?</strong></p>

<p>We said drivers have to keep a distance of 2 seconds, and it is because
we need 2 seconds for our reflexes to, for example, brake. Autonomous
cars do <em>not</em> suffer from this limitation. Of course, they still need
some time, but <strong>it is around 1 second for autonomous cars</strong>, maybe even
less.</p>

<figure class="figure"><div class="figure__main">
<p><a href="/blog/assets/img/posts/2018-11-26-altruistic-autonomy/image2.png"><img class="postimage" src="/blog/assets/img/posts/2018-11-26-altruistic-autonomy/image2.png" /></a></p>
</div><figcaption class="figure__caption" style="padding-top:0;"><p>Autonomous cars can platoon, so more cars can fit on a road!</p>
</figcaption></figure>

<p>This brings about an interesting question: What happens to the FDT when
all cars on the road are autonomous? What if we have a fixed ratio of
autonomous and human-driven cars (we will call this ratio <em>autonomy level</em>)?
We analyzed this and came up with the following modification:</p>

<figure class="figure"><div class="figure__main">
<p><a href="/blog/assets/img/posts/2018-11-26-altruistic-autonomy/image4.png"><img class="postimage" src="/blog/assets/img/posts/2018-11-26-altruistic-autonomy/image4.png" /></a></p>
</div><figcaption class="figure__caption" style="padding-top:0;"><p>Two different FDTs are shown. Solid and dashed lines represent no autonomy and full autonomy, respectively.</p>
</figcaption></figure>

<p>So what happens is the <em>critical density</em>, the highest density where all
cars can move with the maximum speed, increases. This also increases the
<em>maximum flow</em>. However, the <em>maximum density</em> (a.k.a. jam density) does
not change, because that point represents bumper-to-bumper traffic and
it just depends on the lengths of the cars, not the headway. By
increasing autonomy level, we basically move from the old FDT to the new
one.</p>

<h2 id="robustness">Robustness</h2>

<p>The presence of autonomous cars has another important effect on the
mathematical model of traffic. Since we can alter the autonomy levels of
each road, we can have several BNE. So, which is the best among many
BNEs? This sounds a little weird, because we know that all BNEs have the
same latency level. So, we introduce a secondary metric: robustness.</p>

<p>In the routing problem, we assume we are given a flow demand. However,
in real world, how possible is it to know the demand precisely? A small
amount of unpredicted demand can be catastrophic and can lead to
significant (in fact, unbounded) latency increase. Hence, we define the
robustness as follows: A configuration is more robust than the other if
it can allocate more extra flow demand with the same autonomy level,
without increasing the latency. And this maximum extra flow demand is
the quantization of the robustness. For example, in the BNE example
above, the robustness value is the unused flow capacity of 405.</p>

<p>Then we define <em>Robust Best Nash Equilibrium</em> (RBNE) as the BNE that
maximizes robustness. RBNE, too, is not necessarily unique.</p>

<figure class="figure"><div class="figure__main">
<p><a href="/blog/assets/img/posts/2018-11-26-altruistic-autonomy/image3.png"><img class="postimage_unpadded" src="/blog/assets/img/posts/2018-11-26-altruistic-autonomy/image3.png" /></a></p>
</div><figcaption class="figure__caption" style="padding-top:0;"><p>Two different BNEs with different robustness values.</p>
</figcaption></figure>

<p>For example, in the configuration above, the BNE at right is more
robust, In fact, it is an RBNE. Because the 405 benefits more from
autonomy than the Coldwater. Hence, a social planner can make the
routing more robust to unforeseen demand by routing all autonomous
traffic onto the 405.</p>

<h2 id="altruistic-autonomy">Altruistic Autonomy</h2>

<p>We said selfishness of humans is an essential cause of traffic
congestion. The introduction of autonomy opens a new possibility: Can we
have altruistic autonomous cars? Altruism can be obtained in several
ways. For example, public transportation services can be altruistic --
buses can choose to take the longer route for the social good. Or
ride-sharing services, e.g. Lyft or Uber, can offer lower prices to the
customers in the cost of taking the longer route. When autonomous cars
will be available for such services, these options could be further
elaborated.</p>

<p>With this motivation, we define a mathematical altruism profile, which
basically defines what portion of the autonomous cars accept what factor
of altruism. For example, if 10% of the autonomous cars accept an
altruism level of 1.5; this means one in every 10 autonomous vehicles
accepts reaching its destination 1.5 times slower than the other
-selfish- vehicles. This can greatly increase social utility. We define
<em>Best Altruistic Nash Equilibrium</em> (BANE) to be the lowest total latency
routing, given the altruism profile.</p>

</figcaption></figure>

<p>As you can see from the above figure, when a modest portion of the
autonomous cars are altruistic, it is possible for majority of the cars
to use the shortest route without causing congestion. This can
significantly (in fact, unboundedly) decrease the total latency.</p>

<h2 id="mathematical-and-algorithmic-contributions">Mathematical and Algorithmic Contributions</h2>

<p>Other than modeling the FDT with autonomy and analyzing several
different NE, we presented algorithms in the paper that enables finding
BNE, RBNE and BANE (with any altruism profile and autonomy level) in
<strong>polynomial time</strong>. Our formulations are based on convex optimization,
and can be very efficiently solved. For brevity, we do not give the full
details in this blog post and refer to the paper.</p>

<h2 id="simulations-and-results">Simulations and Results</h2>

<p>We used SUMO traffic simulation package to simulate the roads with
different autonomy level and altruism profile. We first evaluated our
FDT model accuracy.</p>

<figure class="figure"><div class="figure__main">
<p><a href="/blog/assets/img/posts/2018-11-26-altruistic-autonomy/image9.png"><img class="postimage_unpadded" src="/blog/assets/img/posts/2018-11-26-altruistic-autonomy/image9.png" /></a></p>
</div><figcaption class="figure__caption" style="padding-top:0;"><p>Theoretical FDT is compared to the simulation results. ⍺ represents the autonomy.</p>
</figcaption></figure>

<p>In the figure above, the black lines represent the theoretical values.
While the simulation results and the theoretical values generally match,
there is a small difference with increasing autonomy, which is because
of the system imperfections in the simulator, such as the road shape and
discretization.</p>

<p>In another experiment, we assessed how much gain we could expect from
RBNE and BANE. We have seen that RBNE halves the total latency compared
to a NE, and BANE can half it again! This means, with BANE, people can
reach their destination in around 2 minutes, whereas they experience a
latency above 8 minutes with the given NE. In fact, we showed that the
improvement of BNE (or RBNE) over NE, and BANE over BNE can be
unboundedly large!</p>

<figure class="figure"><div class="figure__main">
<p><a href="/blog/assets/img/posts/2018-11-26-altruistic-autonomy/image11.png"><img class="postimagesmaller" src="/blog/assets/img/posts/2018-11-26-altruistic-autonomy/image11.png" /></a></p>
</div><figcaption class="figure__caption" style="padding-top:0;"><p>RBNE and BANE have the great potential to reduce latency on the roads.</p>
</figcaption></figure>

<p>We also explored the effect of altruism level on a simple scenario where
all autonomous cars have the same altruism level. In the heat-map below,
colors represent the overall latency (black shows infeasibility),
$\bar{x}$ and $\bar{y}$ denote the total regular and autonomous flow
demand, respectively. And $\kappa_{0}$ is the common altruism factor.
This first map has completely discrete latencies, as it has no altruism.
With increasing altruism, the overall latency decreases and the
insertion of extra cars does not hurt much.</p>

<figure class="figure"><div class="figure__main">
<p><a href="/blog/assets/img/posts/2018-11-26-altruistic-autonomy/image5.png"><img class="postimage" src="/blog/assets/img/posts/2018-11-26-altruistic-autonomy/image5.png" /></a></p>
</div></figure>

<p>Lastly, we have prepared a video that shows the improvements led by our
equilibrium definitions. In this scenario, there are 4 roads between two
points. Each road is shown as a single lane and we present the latency
values in the video below.</p>

<h2 id="future-directions">Future Directions</h2>

<p>In this post, we defined several important notions for traffic networks
under mixed autonomy. We also presented algorithms for computing several
different equilibria in the paper. For practical purposes, the following
questions warrant further research:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>How can we use autonomy to move between equilibria?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can we build incentives for altruism?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can we use autonomy to deal with traffic disturbances such as accidents, closed lanes/bottlenecks, etc.?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How does the results of this work extend to more general network topologies?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully, we can manage to tackle these further questions, and we shall
all suffer slightly less from the stress caused by congested traffic.</p>
